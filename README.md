#SMART CITY STREAMING PROJECT

The goal of this project is to develop a thorough real-time data streaming pipeline for a Smart City project. It records and analyzes real-time data from a car on its way from London to Birmingham, including GPS data, camera footage, emergency incidents, weather, and vehicle data. To guarantee effective data ingestion, processing, storage, and visualization, the pipeline makes use of a combination of Internet of Things devices, Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, Docker, and AWS services.
